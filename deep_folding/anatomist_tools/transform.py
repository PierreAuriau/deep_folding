"""
The aim of this script is to compute transformation files from native MRI space
to normalized SPM space

It scans all subjects from src_dir and looks for morphologist analysis folder,
then produces the transformation file from native space to normalized SPM space,
saves the results (one transformation file per subject) into directory tgt_dir

Examples:
    Specifies the source directory where the MRI data lies, the target directory
    where to put the transform, and the number of subjects to analyse
    (all by default)
        $ python transform.py -s /neurospin/hcp -t /path/to/transfo_dir -n all
        $ python transform.py --help
